//This version of main allows the program to take command-line arguments.
//For example, ./proj2 proj2_books.txt (proj2_books.txt is an argument)
//  The first argument, argc (argument count) is an integer that
//    represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the
//    program when it's executed.
//  The second argument, argv (argument vector) is an array of
//    C-style strings (char*), where each element in the array is
//    one of the command-line arguments passed to the program.
//    These strings represent the arguments as null-terminated
//    character arrays.

//The usage for this is ./proj2 proj2_books.txt where the
//           proj2_books.txt is the name of the input file
